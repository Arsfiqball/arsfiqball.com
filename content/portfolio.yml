- title: Tirtapods-X Robot
  description: >
    A legged firefighting robot which was made for National Robotic Contest 2019.
    This robot is 100% refactor of the previous version Tirtapods.
    Tirtapods-X was mostly built by me, Didi Muhadi and Untirta Robotic Club.
    By our improvements, this robot successfully achieve better result.
    We were finished at Top 5 while in the previous year, we were 22th.<br><br>
    Tirtapods-X is using Arduino Mega (chip: Atmega 328) as microcontroller board.
    I replace all the previous code with mine, re-mapping all the IO, and readjusting the calibration.
    Even though this board can be programmed with C++, it was still not enough.
    Then I was using Observable Notebook to accurately calculate each leg movements.
    So they have far more smooth movement.
    I also use some excel table to automatically calculate calibration.
