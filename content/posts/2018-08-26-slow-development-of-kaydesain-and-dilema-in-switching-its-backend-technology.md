It's been 4 days I start the development of my brand new Kaydesain and I feel it was so slow. I want to keep my app light and fast, but it sacrifice development speed. Maybe I need to change the track?

<!-- more -->

While I want to get away from heavy machine like Laravel and keep trying using Slim, it's painfull that I always miss all feature Laravel have. Build a web app using Laravel is very easy, but less flexible for this project. Laravel have so many features and good default project structure. But my app need more power in front-end. Slim (PHP Framework) is light and fast, easy to use. But when it comes to real development, you'll need to install so many other parts using _composer_ .

I also consider fully switching to Node. From my personal experience, development using JavaScript is easy even if I have to learn so many small packages. Node JS is also always away faster than PHP. But of course if we compare the human resources, PHP still wins in Indonesia. Future development will be more costly if I choose the track to use Node JS.

I need to decide it tomorrow.

### Evaluation

Anyway, there are some other factors slowing down my development. Slow learning, coding without plan, and a little bit depression left from 6 days ago.

I need to admit it. My ability to understand PHP packages is not as fast as JavaScript packages. Even if PHP is more static typed. Maybe because I'm too focusing on this language over year and left PHP untouched.

When I was coding, I also need to think how the application should work. Which is must have already been decided before going to source code. So in the next time, I need to prepare the plan and work only on what's planned.
