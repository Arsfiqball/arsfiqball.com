PT. Krakatau Steel (Persero) or Krakatau Steel Company Limited (in English) is the largest steel maker in Indonesia, headquartered in Cilegon, Banten. The factory location is set on a 700-acre in the western end of Banten and adjacent to the Sunda Strait, and where the Krakatoa volcano and island from which the company takes its name are located.

### First Week in Network Division

Of course large company have so many fields inside it to support the industry, including Information Technology. There are many division to control many aspect of IT in Krakatau Steel (KS). One of them is Network Division where I'm hired as internship student.

This first week, I didn't do many things. Not even doing problem troubleshoot in the plant. I just do monitoring of network connection of all devices using software Paessler Route Traffic Grapher (PRTG). Sometimes read books about computer networks. Sometimes play with Cisco Packet Tracer to practice it.

### Introduced to PRTG

PRTG is a great software to monitor what happen across devices in networks by using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and Windows Management Intstrument (WMI). Mr. Rudy is the first one introduce me about the software. He and Mr. Topik is senior in Network Division and have lots of experience in this particular field. I learn many things from him.

There are several terms to know in PRTG, those are Map, Devices, Sensors, Alarms, Reports, Logs, and ToDos. Each of them have their own functionality to help troubleshoot network problems. Map is the routing map and geographical map of devices across the network. Device is each single piece of hardware used in the network like Switch, Router, Access Point, Computer, CCTV, etc. Sensor is the thing inside the device which is programed to sense and measure aspects in that device. Alarm is a notification to maintainer indicating that something is not working properly or has a warning. Report is a report by maintainer. Log is log message by PRTG itself. ToDo is maintainer note to work with next time.

To make an Alarm, we need something called "Trap" to the sensor. So, if the measurement of sensor is reaching some point it will be traped and alarm created. Of course that alarm will give proper name of the device and which sensor is troubled. Then, because we already have the map of network. We can quickly trace its path and find the actual problem. After that we can just isolate connection and troubleshoot particular device.

That's how PRTG works generally. Details of the software is very complex to explain in single post. But I'm happy to learn lots about network troubleshooting by utilizing this software.

### Daily Life

Every weekdays I need to wake up at early morning because the worktime start at 7:30 AM. I have no personal transport so I have to use the public one. That causes my money to be spent a lot for just go and come back from the office. Wheather at that season is also very unpredictable, sometimes dry, sometimes rainy, Sometimes I go dry and arrive wet. But by the time, I get used to it.

Break time start at 12:00 AM until 1:00 PM and I always start it by taking lunch in HSM Canteen (100m from the office). The food is good and I can take any portion I want. Since I have no time to breakfast, of course want to eat more at the breaktime. Then, I do _Sholat_ in Masjid HSM (20m behind the office).

I went home at 4:30 PM. But not actually to home. Because I have projects in Robotics Lab to build Tirtapod. That time I spent until 10:00 PM then actually go home. I spent a few hours to work with my personal software project then sleep.
