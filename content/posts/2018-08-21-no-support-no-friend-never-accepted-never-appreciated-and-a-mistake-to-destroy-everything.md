These day, I feel like have nothing more to do in my life. It's been enough. I never accepted here. If I could turn back to the time when I want to register to this college, I should've cancel it.

<!-- more -->

Last night is the worst part in my existence here. Seeing all my friend angry at me. Everyone blame me, including myself. It's like I never done anything here. I'm just a trash.

Before last night, I'm a boy who trust in friendship. Keep a friendship and help friends are priority. Even if I have to sacrifice my pride. Even if I have to work hard with no break to help them. Even if I have something to do outside, and do all those thing in parallel. I don't care. I will do it for friendship.

But, no more. For now, till the end of my life, I don't believe it anymore. Humans only care about itself. They compare their work hard with mine. And they feel like I never done anything important. They talk about theirselves. And I'm just a trash in their life.

Please forgive me for my idiot act. I will never distrub you all anymore. You all will be fine without me.

For my girlfriend. Dear, please keep your health. If not, please at least keep alive. I hope you will be alright one day. Thank you. You are the best friend ever in my life. I will always love you, when I'm there or not.
