I just finished an example todolist web app yesterday that was built on top of the most yet popular PHP framework, Laravel. I also deployed it to heroku, so you can see the demo and play with it. (Keep reading, --> click read more)

<!-- more -->

This is my very simple and minimal but high quality coded laravel project. I followed PSR coding standard and enforce my self to write code as clean as possible. The code is not hard to understand (by assuming you were experienced with Laravel).

Laravel provides so much features and concepts that will help you get job done very quickly. In this project I implemented several feature of Laravel like Authentication, Social Media (Facebook) Authentication, Database modeling with eloquent, Eloquent scope, etc.

This project performs good implementation of laravel so you can learn something by exploring the code.

Check this project on github [Arsfiqball/laravel-todolist](https://github.com/Arsfiqball/laravel-todolist)
See the demo here [http://arsfiqball-laravel-todolist.herokuapp.com](http://arsfiqball-laravel-todolist.herokuapp.com)

Happy Hacking! ;)
