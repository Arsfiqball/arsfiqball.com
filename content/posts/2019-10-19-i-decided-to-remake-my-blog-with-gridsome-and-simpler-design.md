Two days ago, I released a new repository on GitHub which contains new
source code for my website and connect Netlify to host it. By that means,
I drop all my work on previous splashy design. Which is hard for me to do
because it cost so much of effort to make it cool and clean website. But I
have more valuable reason to replace it with this new code. It's about how
to quickly tell people who am I, not just impress them with my design ðŸ¤”

#### Motivation

This was started when I saw a Youtube video on my feed from someone I
subscribed. The video told about how to make a good resume. I was excited
and listen carefully. The point which makes me made this decision was
"always make your resume in only one page". That was when I start to think.
You need to make the reader know who you are, in single look and not so
much of action to see the details. People comes to see who am I, what is my
skill, etc. Not my splashy web design. Design might impress the reader.
But more importantly, the reader should be excited because of who you're.

Then I create this website with completely new design. Simpler and quicker
to load. So, people coming to website can see many things about me in just
one or two scroll. This is very different from my previous design which has
so many section in just single homepage. With a cool but inconsistent
information pattern. You need to scroll 7-8 scroll to see all the section.
My contact is also far in the bottom if you use desktop browser.

#### Inspiration

I quickly searched around for simple design I want but never found a good one
for my idea even on Dribbble. That made me a little bit mad. But then I began
to design it myself. While I open someone's GitHub account, I see there was
a link to their website. I remember some programmer I know and searched their
personal website. I thought that maybe I'll get something inspiring. I found it.
I really like [ihwan.id](http://ihwan.id) design. It made with a gatsby based
template created by another programmer. It is simple, fast and anything can be
seen easily.

#### Start making it

I opened up my laptop and start my code editor. I want to build a website
similar to ihwan's but I want it to be easily customisable by me. So I did't
want to use template. Ihwan's website is based on gatsby which is using React
as its base. I understand react, but I have more experience with Vue. So I
browse internet, looking for alternatives. Then I found Gridsome!

Now this is it. You can checkout the repository [here](https://github.com/Arsfiqball/arsfiqball.com).
But I don't recommend you fork it now since it is not yet completed and I will
add more feature in future.

#### Conclusion

We should build our website on correct purpose and focus on it. If we build a
website to show who we're then optimize for it. We don't need to add
unnecessary things.
