It's been 3 weeks since I first using this deck and keep tweaking it till
today. Now, it's quite strong for 1v1 duel and can make a good fight in tag
duel. There is still so many weakness but if managed correctly, this deck
can be very strong and unpredictable. I made it as accurately as possible
to last Playmaker (Yusaku Fujiki) deck duel againts Ai (Dark Ignis). But
because some cards were not yet released or not exist in game engine, I
didn't include it here.
