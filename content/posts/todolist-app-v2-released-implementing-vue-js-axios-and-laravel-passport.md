Yesterday, I finished implementing Vue.js, Axios and Laravel Passport to make my Todolist App looks responsive. The component is not pretty good coded Vue Component. But at least it worked and easy to learn.

<!-- more -->

But I'm still getting stuck in deploying it to Heroku because of its conflict with Laravel Passport. Heroku cannot read ignored file: oauth-public.key and oauth-private.key and I still looking for a good solution. Many of articles and answered questions suggest to put it in .env. But I still do not get a good practice.

Maybe anyone reading this can help!

Go to branch v2 of the repository: [Arsfiqball/laravel-todolist/tree/v2](https://github.com/Arsfiqball/laravel-todolist/tree/v2)
