If you open it right now, you'll see that it's still showing my old project 8 months ago. But in the next few days, I will remake it. In number weeks, new brand with same name will be appear there!

December 2017, Andika Junata, Didik Iskandar and I made that website in progress to build new startup called **KayDesain** which was very positive in the first few days. But after a couple of months, the project was passive. And nothing new after all. We're bussy for our own business and left the website unused.

Following my depression couple days ago. So many things fly in my mind. Run away from business makes me think differently.

I'm surely know about IT stuff and can build something with it. But, I never find a good idea to start a company. I'm also not yet employed because a hard decision between electrical engineering bachelor degree or jurney in software engineering. I already have skill in engineering, but have no degree to be shown in my CV. Indonesian knows how hard it is to apply job without degree.

After 8 months, ah I mean today. I have an idea. I want to make **a platform for freelance graphic designer**. Beside programming, I also have skills in graphic designing. I know what aspects are needed for that. I want to build an ecosystem for freelance graphic designers.

### App Flow

User (client) post a job with title, budget, description, and the most important thing is design context (or 'aspects' in my design). That job will be listed on job list. Then, job owner can pay the budget to label the job as 'ready'.

Another user (worker) can submit a proposal to apply to that job. With only nominal bid and proposal text. So client must review worker's portfolio to choose, also considering nominal bid they expect.

Client then choose worker, and worker start working. Workers can report their progress to client (using preview picture). Of course preview picture must be resized to low and watermarked. Kaydesain must provide that feature to automatically do that.

When project done, worker can upload all project data to Kaydesain. Then client can download it. If client accept, worker paid. If not, client can ask for 2 times revision (free), more than that need to be paid more. If there is problem, admin will take control.

### How workers market thairselves?

By using profile page. It needs to be linked to design sharing platform like Dribbble, Deviantart or even Instagram. Also in future, I want to have a gallery feature in user profile pages.

### Payment system

For starting point, the easiest way is integrating to third party platform like Midtrans and Doku.

### IT

Because PHP is so popular here, and hosting platform is still more cheaper. I will start using PHP for backend. Using slim php framework as the central.

My favorites Vue.JS and Bulma I choose for frontend central. Vue is easy to understand for beginners and Bulma is very intuitive.

Development in beginning of this project should not be complicated. No overkill framework. I will scale it later.
