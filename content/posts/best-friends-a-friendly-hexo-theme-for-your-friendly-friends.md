Couple days ago, I designed my own clean look Hexo Theme named **Best Friends**. It took single day to make it works and pushed it to my Github. It has really simple looks but incredibly very fast to load.

It based on Bulma framework and several additional libraries like jQuery and FontAwesome.

Link to the repo is on the end section of this post.

Best Friends. That two words that was inspiring me to make this theme. Actually, the only thing made me want this theme is, that cover image (on the top left corner of this web). I really want to place it somewhere in my web (before I use this theme). But didn't find the right place to fit.

So, I built my own. I draw it first on paper, how the desktop & mobile will be looks like. Then I learn how Hexo Theme working. I choose to use swig (because I familiar with it). Then quickly searching for a good libraries. That's where I met Bulma. Learning it first is not efficient as my developer mind say. So I "Just use it".

Even if it's looks like working pretty good. There is still some issue there. One of the most annoying is how bulma style the codeblock. It destroy everything inside. I can handle a bit. But I know it's still silly I thought.

If you have solution, I will appreciate it.
